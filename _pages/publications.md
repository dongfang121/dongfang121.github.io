 <span style="font-size:12px;">Microglia link bidirectional immune communication via multiple direct and indirect pathways in depression. (1) Impairment of the BBB leads to the infiltration of peripheral monocytes/macrophages and circulating inflammatory cytokines into the brain, resulting in the activation of microglia. The increased activity of IDO in microglia drives tryptophan metabolism towards the kynurenine pathway, which produces the neurotoxic QUIN and reduces the synthesis of 5-HT. Simultaneously, the dysfunction of endothelial cells results in heightened leukocyte adhesion, thereby creating an environment that triggers inflammation. Furthermore, the activation of microglia can attract a greater number of monocytes for transportation to the brain through the discharge of chemokines. (2) Microglia act as immune sensors of stress responses primarily through the HPA axis. The binding of GC to its receptors can result in anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, or combined effects, which are dependent upon the duration of GC exposure. (3) An alternative approach to regulating neuroimmune interactions involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The activation of microglia can be induced by sympathetic through the β-adrenergic receptors. (4) The inhibition of inflammation is facilitated by the binding of the vagus to the α7nAChR of microglia through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways. (5) The microbiota generates a diverse range of SCFAs, which traverse the BBB and demonstrate immunomodulatory properties on microglia. Additionally, they contribute to the maturation of microglia. (6) The activation of microglial PKA and PKB to block GSK3β, which subsequently inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and ultimately reduces oxidation and inflammation, may account for the antidepressant effect of multiple drugs or pathways. (7) The oxidation and inflammation afterward stimulate additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, ROS, and RNS. The cascade of events ultimately causes elevated levels of glutamate, QUIN, and GC, as well as decreased levels of 5-HT and BDNF, culminating in depressive symptoms. (8) Moreover, the susceptibility to depression is closely linked with epigenetic alterations in microglia. The aforementioned pathways represent three distinct modes of bidirectional immune communication between the peripheral and central systems. These include the humoral pathway, which is linked to the BBB, the neural pathway, which is associated with the vagus and sympathetic nerves, and the cellular pathway, which is connected to microglia.
