<p><strong>1. Memories during the three years of the pandemic COVID-19</strong></p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I participated in the school's voluntary nucleic acid testing activities and was responsible for maintaining order on-site. Additionally, in 2021, I volunteered at the "Yunlong Lake Future Healthcare Forum" conference.

"College Student Summer Volunteering Activities" is a university-organized volunteer service event that takes place during the summer months (July-August) aimed at encouraging young people to bring urban technological, cultural, and health knowledge to underdeveloped and remote areas for social development.<br>
<br>
During the event, we distributed flyers on health and safety knowledge on the streets, provided free blood sugar and blood pressure measurements for passersby, performed songs and dances for the elderly in nursing homes, and taught left-behind children to draw.  I've attended this meaningful event twice, and every single activity has left an indelible impression on me.
