<p><strong>1. Memories during the three years of the pandemic COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I participated in the school's voluntary nucleic acid testing activities and was responsible for maintaining order on-site. Additionally, in 2021, I volunteered at the "Yunlong Lake Future Healthcare Forum" conference.</p>

<p>"College Student Summer Volunteering Activities" is a volunteer service event organized by the university that takes place during the summer months (July-August). The event aims to encourage young people to bring urban technological, cultural, and health knowledge to underdeveloped and remote areas for social development.<br></p>
<p>During the event, activities will include distributing flyers on health and safety knowledge on the streets, offering free blood sugar and blood pressure measurements for passersby, performing songs and dances for the elderly in nursing homes, and teaching left-behind children how to draw. I have attended this meaningful event twice, and every activity has left an indelible impression on me.</p>
