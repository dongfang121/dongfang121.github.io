Many central nervous system diseases are closely associated with neuroinflammation. When peripheral inflammatory cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier, they ignite the central immune system with the potential to cause abnormal behaviors in individuals, such as reduced motor activity and anhedonia. However, the specific brain regions responsible for perceiving peripheral immune signals and the neural circuits regulating immune responses in this complex process remain unclear.<br>
<br>
We administered intraperitoneal injections of cytokines (interleukin-4, interleukin-17A) and utilized c-Fos staining to identify the activated brain regions. Subsequently, we intend to employ viral tracing techniques and transgenic mice to further explore neural circuits and molecular mechanisms. In this research, we aim to delineate the neural circuits that regulate the balance between peripheral immune responses and central immune responses, providing new insights for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related diseases.<br>

The connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established, although the shared mechanism is still unclear. The goal of the current study is to delve deeper into the shared genes and immune landscapes that underpin the co-occurrence of SLE and MDD. <br>
<br>
The datasets of SLE-related (GSE121239, GSE81622, GSE162577) and MDD-related (GSE98793, GSE76826, GSE217086) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The co-expressed genes were discovered using weighted correlation network analysis and analysis of differentially expressed genes. We performed the enrichment analysis of shared genes, protein-protein interaction analysis, four machine learning algorithms, immunocyte infiltration, and single-cell analysis of the hub genes in SLE and MDD.<br>
<br>
Finally, we found six co-expressed genes were determined, and the key gene IL7R was derived in the subsequent validation tests. IL7R expression declined in patients with SLE or MDD in contrast to controls, and IL7R had a high diagnostic value in both conditions. Additionally, IL7R is associated with immunodeficiency, T cell receptors, and multiple types of infectious diseases, as well as a strong relationship with immune infiltration. Our study first revealed that the IL-7/IL-7R signaling pathway was a common pathogenesis of SLE and MDD, and it represented the potential as a gene candidate for targeting the treatment of both SLE and MDD patients.<br>

<strong>3. Target TRPML1 to Alleviate Depressive-like Behaviors by Suppressing IL-1β Production in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</font></strong><br>

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia, while interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is closely linked with MDD symptoms like anhedonia. Microglia are the main immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, are released from microglia, resulting in neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which affects mood and cognition in individuals. Our previous research has demonstrated that activation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCOLN1">TRPML1 channel</a> (a cationic channel localized on the lysosomal membrane) inhibits macrophage IL-1β production. Therefore, this project aimed to investigate whether regulating microglial IL-1β production in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by manipulating the TRPML1 channel alleviated inflammation-associated depressive-like behaviors. <br>
<br>  
In vitro experiments, BV2 cells and primary rat microglia were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish inflammation models of microglia. In vivo experiments, repeated lateral ventricular injection of LPS or chronic restraint stress (CRS) was used to establish the inflammation model of depression in mice (MCOLN1<sup>+/+</sup> and MCOLN1<sup>+/-</sup> mice). Finally, we found that down-regulated TRPML1 activity might underlie the pathogenesis of MDD; TRPML1 channel activation suppressed transcriptional IL1B in microglia by modulating the release of lysosomal Fe<sup>2+</sup>; in vivo stimulation of TRPML1 alleviated both LPS- and CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice; the anti-depressive effects of TRPML1 resulted from its suppression of microglial IL-1β production and subsequent microglial activation.
