<strong>1. Explore the Circuit Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Cytokines on Neuroinflammation</font></strong><br>

Many central nervous system diseases are closely associated with neuroinflammation. When peripheral inflammatory cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier, they ignite the central immune system with the potential to cause abnormal behaviors in individuals, such as reduced motor activity and anhedonia. However, the specific brain regions responsible for perceiving peripheral immune signals and the neural circuits regulating immune responses in this complex process remain unclear.<br>
<br>
We administered intraperitoneal injections of cytokines and utilized c-Fos staining to identify the activated brain regions. Subsequently, we intend to employ viral tracing techniques and transgenic mice to further explore neural circuits and molecular mechanisms. In this research, we aim to delineate the neural circuits that regulate the balance between peripheral immune responses and central immune responses, providing new insights for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related diseases.<br>

<br>
The connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established, although the shared mechanism is still unclear. The goal of the current study is to delve deeper into the shared genes and immune landscapes that underpin the co-occurrence of SLE and MDD. <br>

<strong>3. Target TRPML1 to Regulate Depressive-like Behaviors</font></strong><br>

- Description:<br>
<br>
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. Microglia are the main immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are released from microglia, resulting in neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which affects mood and cognition in individuals. This research focused on the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCOLN1">TRPML1 channel</a> (a cationic channel localized on the lysosomal membrane) in neuroinflammation-associated depressive-like behaviors. <br>

<small>As illustrated in the figure, microglia in the LPS group exhibit enlarged cell bodies and shortened processes, indicative of an activated state. Conversely, treatment with ML-SA5 induces microglial morphology resembling the resting state.</small>
