Many central nervous system diseases are closely associated with neuroinflammation. When peripheral inflammatory cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier, they ignite the central immune system with the potential to cause abnormal behaviors in individuals, such as reduced motor activity and anhedonia. However, the specific brain regions responsible for perceiving peripheral immune signals and the neural circuits regulating immune responses in this complex process remain unclear. We administered intraperitoneal injections of cytokines (IL-4, IL-17A) and utilized c-Fos staining to identify the activated brain regions. Subsequently, we intend to employ viral tracing techniques and transgenic mice to further explore neural circuits and molecular mechanisms. In this research, we aim to delineate the neural circuits that regulate the balance between peripheral immune responses and central immune responses, providing new insights for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related diseases.<br>
