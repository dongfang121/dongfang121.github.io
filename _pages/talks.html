<strong>1. 修改中...Explore Mechanisms of Cytokines on Neuroinflammation and Addiction</font></strong> (In progress)<br>

- Description:<br>
  <br>
Many central nervous system diseases are closely associated with neuroinflammation. When peripheral inflammatory cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier, they activate the central immune system, potentially leading to abnormal behaviors in individuals, such as decreased motor activity and anhedonia. However, the specific brain regions responsible for perceiving peripheral immune signals and the neural circuits regulating immune responses in this complex process remain unclear.<br>

<strong>2. Investigate the Immunological Relationship between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Major Depressive Disorder</font></strong> (Completed)<br>
- January 01, 2023~March 01, 2024<br>
- Research assistant (Work Supervisor: Dr. Jiaoqiong Guan), Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai, China<br>
- Description:<br>
  <br>
The connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established, although the shared mechanism is still unclear. The goal of the current study is to further investigate the shared genes and immune landscapes that contribute to the co-occurrence of SLE and MDD. <br>

<strong>3. Targeting Microglia to Alleviate Depressive-like Behaviors</font></strong> (In progress)<br>
- September 01, 2020~July 01, 2023<br>
- Master's Degree Research (Master's Thesis Supervisor: Prof. Dr. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1875-5463">Wuyang Wang</a>), Xuzhou Medical University, Department of Anesthesiology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China<br>
- Description:<br>
  <br>
MDD is a psychiatric condition characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. Microglia are the primary immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are released from microglia, leading to neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which impact mood and cognition in individuals. This research focused on the mechanism of microglia in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviors.<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">  
<small>As illustrated in the figure, microglia in the LPS group exhibited enlarged cell bodies and shortened processes, indicative of an activated state. Conversely, treatment with our drug induced microglial morphology resembling a resting state.</small></div>
