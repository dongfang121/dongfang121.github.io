<strong>1. Explore Mechanisms of Cytokines on Neuroinflammation and Addiction</font></strong><br>

- Description:<br>
<br>
Many central nervous system diseases are closely associated with neuroinflammation. When peripheral inflammatory cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier, they ignite the central immune system with the potential to cause abnormal behaviors in individuals, such as reduced motor activity and anhedonia. However, the specific brain regions responsible for perceiving peripheral immune signals and the neural circuits regulating immune responses in this complex process remain unclear.<br>

<strong>2. Investigate the Immunological Relationship between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Major Depressive Disorder</font></strong><br>
- January 01, 2023~March 01, 2024<br>

- Description:<br>
<br>
The connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established, although the shared mechanism is still unclear. The goal of the current study is to delve deeper into the shared genes and immune landscapes that underpin the co-occurrence of SLE and MDD. <br>

<strong>3. Target Microglia to Regulate Depressive-like Behaviors</font></strong><br>
- September 01, 2020~July 01, 2023<br>

- Description:<br>
<br>
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. Microglia are the main immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are released from microglia, resulting in neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which affects mood and cognition in individuals. This research focused on the mechanism of microglia in LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors. <br>

<small>As illustrated in the figure, microglia in the LPS group exhibited enlarged cell bodies and shortened processes, indicative of an activated state. Conversely, treatment with our drug induced microglial morphology resembling a resting state.</small>
