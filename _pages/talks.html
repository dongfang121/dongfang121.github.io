<strong>1. Mendelian Randomization Analysis of Multiregional Psychiatric Disorders and Their Associated Symptoms</font></strong> (In progress)<br>

- <strong>Description:</font></strong><br>
<strong>Psychiatric disorders</font></strong> (e.g., depression, anxiety, addiction) are a major global health challenge. These conditions often <strong>co-occur and share biological roots</font></strong>, such as neurotransmitter issues and inflammation. While studies show shared <strong>genetic risks</font></strong> across these disorders, the direct links between <strong>genes and symptoms</font></strong> remain unclear.
</div>

We are addressing this issue using publicly available <strong>genome-wide association study (GWAS)</font></strong> data by combining <strong>Mendelian randomization (MR)</font></strong> methods, <strong>gene/protein analysis (TWAS/PWAS)</font></strong>, and <strong>colocalization</font></strong>.
</div>

Our objectives are two-fold: (1) to develop a <strong>cross-disorder genetic causal map</font></strong> that highlights shared genetic influences on diverse psychopathological dimensions; and (2) to prioritize therapeutic targets with <strong>cross-diagnostic potential</font></strong>, grounded in causal evidence, to inform precision interventions for mental health conditions.

<strong>2. Comprehensive Single-cell Analysis of Microglia in Depression</font></strong> (Completed)<br>

- <strong>Description:</font></strong><br>
<strong>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</font></strong> is strongly linked to <strong>neuroimmune dysfunction</font></strong>, but the exact mechanisms of communication between <strong>microglia</font></strong> and <strong>GABAergic neurons</font></strong> remain unclear. Using <strong>single-nucleus RNA-seq data</font></strong> of MDD patients and healthy controls (sourced from the GEO database), we analyzed microglial subtypes and their interactions with GABAergic neurons and prioritized key genes and biomarkers using <strong>69 machine learning models</font></strong>, followed by <strong>Mendelian randomization (MR)</font></strong> to assess causality between microglial features and MDD risk.
</div>
<br> 
<strong>Three microglial subtypes</font></strong> were identified. Machine learning analysis of two microglia subtypes distinguished MDD patients from healthy controls with <strong>moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.7–0.8)</font></strong>. MR analysis highlighted subtype-specific genetic risk and protective factors for MDD. Pathway analysis revealed disrupted interactions between microglia and GABAergic neurons, including <strong>reduced anti-inflammatory signaling</font></strong> and <strong>excessive pro-inflammatory activity</font></strong>.
</div>
<br> 
Our study suggests that impaired neuroimmune signaling—characterized by <strong>metabolic imbalances</font></strong> and <strong>chronic neuroinflammation</font></strong> driven by abnormal microglia-GABAergic neuron communication—contributes to MDD. These findings identify potential targets for restoring neuroimmune balance in MDD.

<strong>3. Immune Mechanisms of the Comorbidity of SLE and MDD</font></strong> (Completed)<br>
- Jul.2023-Jul.2024<br>

- <strong>Description:</font></strong><br>
Patients with <strong>systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</font></strong> face a higher risk of <strong> major depressive disorder (MDD)</font></strong>, yet the shared <strong>immune</font></strong> mechanisms underlying comorbidity progression remain elusive. SLE-MDD datasets from GEO underwent WGCNA and differential expression analysis to identify co-expressed modules. A panel of <strong>101 machine learning algorithms</font></strong> was applied to select hub genes and construct <strong>diagnostic models</font></strong>, followed by immune infiltration and functional enrichment analyses. The potential biomarker was validated using <strong>public single-cell RNA-seq data</font></strong>, <strong>immunohistochemistry</font></strong>, and <strong>Western blot</font></strong>.
</div>
<br> 
Finally, we propose an <strong>immune target</font></strong> that may underlie the shared immune pathogenesis driving comorbidity progression by influencing the function and number of <strong>T-cell subtypes</font></strong>. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies to slow the concurrent progression of both diseases.

<strong>4. Microglial Autophagy in Alleviating Depression</font></strong> (In progress)<br>

- <strong>Description:</font></strong><br>
<strong>Major deppressive disorder</font></strong> is a psychiatric condition characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. <strong>Microglia</font></strong> are the primary immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are released from microglia, leading to neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which impact mood and cognition in individuals. This research focused on the mechanism of microglia in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviors.<br>

<small>As illustrated in the figure, microglia in the LPS group exhibited enlarged cell bodies and shortened processes, indicative of an activated state. Conversely, treatment with our drug induced microglial morphology resembling a resting state.</small></div>
