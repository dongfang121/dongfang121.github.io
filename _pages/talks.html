  <br>
The pathogenesis of <strong>depression</font></strong> is complex. By leveraging  <strong>bioinformatics</font></strong> to integrate multi-source data (e.g., gene expression data, protein-protein interaction data, clinical data), it is possible to efficiently identify key genes, signaling pathways, and biological processes closely associated with the onset of depression, thereby providing reliable new insights into the mechanisms underlying depression. In research related to microglia in depression, the focus has primarily been on phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, and metabolic changes. However, the specific characteristics of <strong>the interactions between microglia and neurons</font></strong> in the context of depression remain unclear. This study employs single-cell analysis techniques (e.g., CellChat, SCENIC, Monocle) combined with Mendelian Randomization (MR), transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to investigate the interaction between microglia and neurons in depression. The aim is to elucidate the mechanisms of microglia-neuron interactions in specific brain regions of depression patients, providing new strategies and directions for microglia-targeted depression treatment.<br>

<strong>2. Immune Mechanisms of Cytokines in Addiction</font></strong> (In progress)<br>

- Description:<br>
  <br>
<strong>Addiction</font></strong> is a brain dysfunction disorder induced by chronic drug exposure, characterized by compulsive drug-seeking and recurrent drug use. Studies have demonstrated that addictive substances (e.g., cocaine, opioids) activate <strong>central immunocytes (microglia, astrocytes)</font></strong>, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), which subsequently modulate addictive behaviors. Critical unresolved questions include: (1) How cytokine dynamics in distinct brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, amygdala) influence addiction stages (drug intake → withdrawal → relapse); (2) How cytokines interact with dopamine/glutamate systems to coordinately regulate addiction-associated neural circuits. This study employs transgenic mouse models of addiction combined with immunofluorescence and other techniques to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of key cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α) on synaptic plasticity and neural circuit remodeling across addiction stages. Furthermore, it explores targeted cytokine intervention strategies, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation for immunomodulation-based addiction therapies.   .<br>

<strong>3. Immune Mechanisms of the Comorbidity of SLE and Depression</font></strong> (Completed)<br>

  <br>
<strong>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</font></strong>is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, in which the incidence of comorbid <strong>depression</font></strong> can reach up to 78.6%, significantly higher than that in the general population. However, current treatments for SLE-associated depression remain predominantly reliant on conventional antidepressants, with limited therapeutic efficacy, underscoring the urgent need to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this comorbidity.
  
The characteristic systemic inflammation in SLE (e.g., elevated IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-α levels) may disrupt the blood-brain barrier, activate central immune cells (microglia and astrocytes), and induce neuroinflammation alongside dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, dopamine, and GABAergic systems), thereby driving depressive phenotypes. Additionally, autoantibodies may directly target neurons, impairing synaptic plasticity and neural circuit functionality. Notably, routine SLE therapeutics such as glucocorticoids may exacerbate depressive symptoms by inducing neuronal apoptosis or suppressing neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), creating a vicious cycle of treatment-induced exacerbation.

Given the high prevalence and suboptimal management of depression in SLE patients, mechanism-based precision interventions are critically needed. This study aims to elucidate the immunopathological mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of SLE and depression, with the goal of informing novel therapeutic approaches for immune-related neuropsychiatric disorders.<br>

<strong>4. Microglial Autophagy in Alleviating Depression</font></strong> (In progress)<br>

- Description:<br>
  <br>
MDD is a psychiatric condition characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. Microglia are the primary immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are released from microglia, leading to neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which impact mood and cognition in individuals. This research focused on the mechanism of microglia in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviors.<br>
