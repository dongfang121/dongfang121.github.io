  <br>
With the progression of bioinformatics, the molecular mechanisms underlying depression have garnered significant attention. Microglia, pivotal immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS), undergo specific molecular alterations in depression, potentially facilitating its onset. However, the precise characteristics and therapeutic targets of microglia in depression remain elusive. This study, by leveraging bioinformatics, aims to elucidate these aspects and provide novel treatment strategies.<br>

<strong>2. Explore Mechanisms of Cytokines on Neuroinflammation and Addiction</font></strong> (In progress)<br>

- Description:<br>
  <br>
Numerous central nervous system disorders exhibit a close correlation with neuroinflammation. The ingress of peripheral inflammatory cytokines across the blood-brain barrier stimulates the central immune system, potentially inducing aberrant behaviors such as hypokinesia and anhedonia. However, the precise brain regions implicated in the perception of peripheral immune signals, as well as the neural circuits governing immune responses within this intricate process, remain elusive. This study aims to explore the crucial role of specific cytokines in the formation and relapse of drug addiction.<br>

<strong>3. Investigate the Immunological Relationship between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Major Depressive Disorder</font></strong> (Completed)<br>

- Description:<br>
  <br>
The connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established, although the shared mechanism is still unclear. The goal of the current study is to further investigate the shared genes and immune landscapes that contribute to the co-occurrence of SLE and MDD. <br>

<strong>4. Targeting Microglia to Alleviate Depressive-like Behaviors</font></strong> (In progress)<br>
- Sep.2020-Jul.2023<br>

- Description:<br>
  <br>
MDD is a psychiatric condition characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. Microglia are the primary immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to stimuli, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are released from microglia, leading to neuronal excitotoxicity, synaptic pruning, and demyelination, which impact mood and cognition in individuals. This research focused on the mechanism of microglia in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviors.<br>

<small>As illustrated in the figure, microglia in the LPS group exhibited enlarged cell bodies and shortened processes, indicative of an activated state. Conversely, treatment with our drug induced microglial morphology resembling a resting state.</small></div>
